Notes:

To programmers wishing to use the Twofish code:  please see the
example code (and comments) at the end of the file AES.H showing how 
the Twofish functions are typically used.

The program TST2FISH.EXE will generate the full set of KAT/MCT/Tables 
files in the current directory, if run with the -M switch:

        TST2FISH -M

When run without command-line parameters, it will generate a partial MCT set,
since the full set takes a long time.

When run with a question mark character ('?') as a parameter, TST2FISH.EXE
will display a help screen of command line options.

It is recommended that the version of TST2FISH.EXE compiled with the
optimized ANSI C code be used to generate the full MCT file set, since
the reference version is considerably slower.
