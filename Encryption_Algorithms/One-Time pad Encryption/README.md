Language used – Python.

Tkinter – This module is used to make GUIs using python language.

Basics of Cryptography – Cryptography is used for Secure Communication.
```
Encryption – The process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.
Decryption – The process of taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text.

Algorithm used ONE-TIME PAD
```
The one-time pad is a type of encryption which is unbreakable. 
A one-time pad will generate a key, this key is shared by both the user so it does encryption as well as decryption.
The key used is generated randomly and this key is combined with the plain text in order to form the ciphertext. 
We can use different algorithms for the generation of the ciphertext such as modular addition, modular XOR, etc.
Since the key generated every time is unique, it is impossible to break.
